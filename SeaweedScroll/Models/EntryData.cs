One of the great things about Japan is their appreciation for nature and their love of the environment. Real estate here may be some of the most expensive in the world. Shops frequently will build up rather than build out because it is cheaper to just build a second, third, or seventh floor than to rent a wider space. Yet, despite this, the Japanese refuse to compromise on getting rid of the lush greenery we saw oddly and peacefully situated in the midst of this bustling city."

This is simply something that you do if you are Japanese. The true faith of the Japanese is being Japanese. They work hard and follow the way of the warrior (bushidou) because they are Japanese. They call themselves Shinto and Buddhist and go to the temple to pray that their wishes and dreams will be answered because they are Japanese and this is what Japanese do."

This really hit us on our way back to the hotel.  We had to take a round about way with three different trains and alot of confusion.  Why? Because the main train line we needed to take was shut down due to a \"person related accident\". Most likely that meant someone had walked in front of a train and commited suicide.  It really hit home the fact that so many people will end they life because they feel that they have no purpose and nothing fulfills them they way only God could.  Japan is losing many people to saddness, loneliness, and overworking every year.  Please pray for the people of Japan and the missionaries and Christians who are trying to reach these people whom God loves so very dearly."

The internet connection from our hotel room seems to be very strong, so praise God that there will be few complications! The flight in was rather simple, all things considered. Just a 1 hour flight to Toronto and a 13 hour and 20 minute flight to Tokyo. Then another hour-long bus ride to a place that was close enough to our hotel that we could afford a taxi. We were immediately greeted by the familiar excellent customer service that comes standard in Japan. I was pretty tired when we first got in, but when we saw the city, I knew I couldn't miss a second of it! We rode down through Shibuya and Shinjuku on our way to the train station, and it was pretty amazing to be greeted with the lights, the crowds, the narrow streets, the skyscrapers.

We learned about the many ways God is fulfilling His promise of bringing people from every nation, tribe, peoples, and languages to His saving grace. This course set our spirits on fire, and we began to pray fervently for direction and guidance as we sought a ministry vision for the people of Japan. Through those months of constant prayer, God revealed to us the needs of the hikikomori, those who isolate themselves from six months to many decades. God revealed the pieces of this vision to us like a jigsaw puzzle -- giving us clues and pieces that seemed as though they might never fit together. The more we prayed, the more we saw God’s faithfulness in connecting these seemingly disconnected pieces. Seeing a few pieces at a time come together to form a unified piece of the puzzle has been riveting! We believe based on what we've seen thus far of the puzzle is that God desires for us to create an online community of hikikomori and to use games, blogs, and various forms of media to connect with these people. Our goal is to cultivate a community, lead by the Holy Spirit, who will love others in the community supernaturally as Christ loves us. We will be meeting their relational needs, but also meeting their emotional needs by connecting them with anonymous, professional counseling. We believe God desires to transform these people and set them free from their self-confinement then go on to reach their friends and family for the Gospel."

I felt like God might be calling me to start an online discipleship group at our church, but I wasn't exactly sure where I would start or who I could invite to come. I thought that perhaps I had misheard from God, but Amanda urged me to continue waiting. I’m very glad I did. I connected with a very interesting man by the name of Matt Souza. Him and his wife run an online gaming church whose mission is to reach gamers throughout the world. The group is known as GodSquad gaming. I met with Pastor Souzy, as he is fondly known in his church, and we discussed vision. \"How exactly are you going to reach these shut-ins in Japan,\" Souza asked me, to which I replied honestly, \"I don’t know exactly. I was hoping your church could help with that!\" I was certainly stumped in that moment, but I knew that I had stumbled across something good. Here was someone who was not only doing what I believed God was calling me to do right here in this moment, but someone who clearly has a lot of these details worked out and can help further us in our future vision in Japan. We plan on meeting Pastor Souzy and his wife in person in February. After that, we’re going to start serving alongside his staff to learn exactly what makes this ministry so successful. Praise God!"

We are starting out the year in a very exciting way by going on our vision trip to Tokyo! We will be leaving Tuesday, the 15th, and returning on the 25th. Amanda and I are incredibly excited to see what God wants to show us in Tokyo! We are looking forward to meeting with potential ministry partners and meeting the folks who may one day be our family far from home."
