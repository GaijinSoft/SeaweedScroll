Monday we spent the first part of our day visiting my company’s Tokyo branch. I want to be careful what I share on a public website, so I would love to provide more specifics to you all in person. There is no official move to this office in the books quite yet, but when the time comes, we believe a move to this office may very well be possible. After a lot of prayer and talking with others, I do think that if I am able to transfer to this office, it would work out just fine! There are so many more details I long to share with you, but I will have to share them with you all in person. I will say that it will be very different than what I am accustomed to in our American offices, but I also believe that I am ready for the challenge."

                            Text = "Tuesday, our potential missionary partner (first Andy), took us to an onsen (or hot spring). Guys and girls were separated of course, but for those of you who don’t know, the onsen experience is a very “natural” one. We entered the building and were greeted with signs that explained rules such as “Please wash thoroughly before entering the bath” and “No tattoos permitted”. The second one can come as a kind of shock to foreigners especially because of the prevalence of tattoos in the US. In Japan, no one has tattoos except for members of the Japanese mafia, the yakuza. So by not allowing tattoos they try to make sure that there won’t be any issues or discomfort in the experience. So to go to the onsens, you have to bring two towels that are of a specific size. You take your shoes off before entering the wooden floors and put these in one locker, then you disrobe completely past the gender-separated area and put the rest of your valuables in another locker. After locking everything you are given a key on a bracelet that you can keep with you while you are there. Before entering any of the baths, you must sit at the washing stations. You are given a bucket and all kinds of shampoos, soaps, and conditioners, and a detachable shower head. Everything in the entire room is connected to a drain which is very nice because you can have some fun and dump the buckets out onto the floor when you’re done with them. After washing, there were multiple stations both inside and outside you could go to. There was a tepid station with the water at about 95 degrees that felt like warm bath water all the way up to the very hot bath that will leave you sweating. The baths also had minerals in them which created little bubbles on your skin which are good for your skin and are said to be good for your health. Outside was more of the same with some individual baths that were constantly overflowing that you could sit inside of. After spending too long in the very hot bath which caused me to sweat, I got very dizzy when I left, so I cooled off for a while and spent a while just talking with Andy. There was also one bath which was an ice water bath. Andy and I both took the plunge which was immediately very painful but you quickly got used to it and felt invigorated. After washing up once more to remove the minerals, we all reconveined as a group and felt nice and clean and refreshed. The entire experience was 90 minutes long, and despite all of the stations it cost a mere 600¥ (less than $6)!"

We went to a conveyer belt sushi restaurant at a popular chain called Sushiro which was a lot of fun. Then we returned to the hotel and decided to see what the buzz was all about by watching Tidying Up with Marie Kondo (don’t judge). It was appropriate being in Japan because I hadn’t realized she was Japanese."

We met with two folks who have been living here for several months to years and asked them a lot of questions about life here in Japan. We also met with a Japanese realtor on the way, and I was able to speak just enough Japanese to figure out what potential options in Japan could look like. There were some reasonably priced options that were surprisingly large for what we would expect in Tokyo which was a huge relief to us. We asked our friends so many questions from living expenses and how fast the internet was to asking how to make friends in Japan and how to balance work and ministry. We felt quite satisfied with the answers that we received and our contacts were incredibly helpful. At the end of the day we realized that we can’t figure out everything right now, but to have so many of our questions answered gave us an important sense of confidence. I’ve got to run for the day. Thank you all so much for your prayers. God is so incredibly good! God bless you all!"

As you may know, we feel God pulling us towards online ministry to help the hikikomori (shut-ins of Japan).

This is one of the areas we’ve been prayerfully considering living in when we return for longer term. Two of their missionaries were returning home to the US after spending their whole lives on the field. When we opened the doors to the party room, we were greeted with a diverse gathering of people. Upon seeing us, we quickly lost track of who it was that was showing us around. Everyone was so excited to talk to us that each new person we met insisted on showing us around to all the other members of the team. It was a kind and warm welcome to their team. Their ministries were brilliant, creative, eclectic, and it was evident that God was changing hearts and lives through these humble, ordinary yet quirky folks. The party itself had a fine musk of life overseas, like walking into the home of a close friend. You could tell their lives were filled with the kind of dichotomous glory so evident in those who lay down their lives before the cross to be given something greater in return -- heartache yet joy, stress yet peace, difficulty yet freedom. It was authentic, and this is exactly what we had hoped to see on this vision trip. We talked about the organizational structure, heard many stories, sang songs, and witnessed the bitter-sweet tears of nostalgic reflection honoring these people who had spent their lives in service to God. It was truly a beautiful evening."

By the providence of God, we managed to meet up with a friend from the Japanese church in Pittsburgh who happened to be in Japan for a period of time. He invited us to a tea party for an organization that mobilized Japanese into small groups for discipleship. We made friends, shared laughs, raised hands and worshipped in Japanese alongside our brothers and sisters who live 6700 miles away from us. It was a truly blessed time together. We encountered this back in our 2016 trip to Kyoto, but one of the things that was truly inspiring to us was the deep sincerity and overwhelming acceptance and friendship of the Japanese Christians. To be a Christian in Japan is largely seen as forsaking most things Japanese and risking the harmony of every relationship you have. These Christians are on the edge, their spirits are ablaze, and their hearts are for reaching their people. We were amazed at the number of small groups and small group leaders in the relatively tiny size of the group. Though about 90% of the afternoon was in nothing but Japanese (some of it more complicated than others), we made some bilingual friends who were happy to help us understand everything that was said. Besides the love, camaraderie, and sincerity of the Japanese Christians, what really struck me was the need for connection in Japanese society and the power of small groups to meet this need in a transformative way. Finding ways to connect the Japanese to one another through the Body of Christ I believe is a big part of what we will need to help facilitate if we want to see movements for Christ throughout this country. We had some wonderful conversations bouncing ideas off of other mission-minded believers about the power of technology and the internet in its potential to reach the lost. We are on the bleeding edge of learning to use technology to connect to one another in a meaningful way, so it is very exciting to dream of the possibilities. It seems God knew exactly what He was doing when He made Sam a very extroverted ENFJ (Myers’ Briggs) software engineer."

Afterwards, we had the chance to talk with one of his friends who is studying to be a social worker who had studied about the hikikomori.

We’ve had questions answered and our ideas challenged. We’ve got a true flavor of life in Japan, and we’ve had most of our prayers on our Support page answered already. The missions partners that have been traveling with us on the trip have offered their blessing and have assured us of their confidence in us which has been deeply comforting. Amanda and I have been praying and when we look at each other at the end of the day, we both seem to feel the same way -- Japan just feels like home. We have been walking in step with the Holy Spirit for the last 4 years as He has guided us through this journey. Starting with baby steps, then taking longer and greater strides. It seems that God has given us His peace about this place, which is a significant answer to prayer. This trip has been a true blessing to us thus far, and we are so grateful that there is even more that God wants to show us. One of the prayers that we are still praying for is where exactly God is calling our family to live. We have a few ideas, but we hope that we can spend the next few days wrestling with these questions while we continue to spend time with the remaining contacts God has given us. Please keep us in your prayers. We have been busy running all around Tokyo, occasionally jumping on the wrong train, and actually meeting or exceeding the daily number of recommended steps (can you believe we’re supposed to walk 10,000 steps a day!?), but we have also found beautiful moments to appreciate and enjoy the culture and have fun. We will post those pictures as soon as we get them all uploaded! God bless you all. We love every last one of you!"

Shops frequently will build up rather than build out because it is cheaper to just build a second, third, or seventh floor than to rent a wider space.

This really hit us on our way back to the hotel.  We had to take a round about way with three different trains and alot of confusion.  Why? Because the main train line we needed to take was shut down due to a \"person related accident\". Most likely that meant someone had walked in front of a train and commited suicide.  It really hit home the fact that so many people will end they life because they feel that they have no purpose and nothing fulfills them they way only God could.  Japan is losing many people to saddness, loneliness, and overworking every year.  Please pray for the people of Japan and the missionaries and Christians who are trying to reach these people whom God loves so very dearly."

The internet connection from our hotel room seems to be very strong, so praise God that there will be few complications! The flight in was rather simple, all things considered. Just a 1 hour flight to Toronto and a 13 hour and 20 minute flight to Tokyo. Then another hour-long bus ride to a place that was close enough to our hotel that we could afford a taxi. We were immediately greeted by the familiar excellent customer service that comes standard in Japan. I was pretty tired when we first got in, but when we saw the city, I knew I couldn't miss a second of it! We rode down through Shibuya and Shinjuku on our way to the train station, and it was pretty amazing to be greeted with the lights, the crowds, the narrow streets, the skyscrapers.

We learned about the many ways God is fulfilling His promise of bringing people from every nation, tribe, peoples, and languages to His saving grace. This course set our spirits on fire, and we began to pray fervently for direction and guidance as we sought a ministry vision for the people of Japan. Through those months of constant prayer, God revealed to us the needs of the hikikomori, those who isolate themselves from six months to many decades. God revealed the pieces of this vision to us like a jigsaw puzzle -- giving us clues and pieces that seemed as though they might never fit together. The more we prayed, the more we saw God’s faithfulness in connecting these seemingly disconnected pieces. Seeing a few pieces at a time come together to form a unified piece of the puzzle has been riveting! We believe based on what we've seen thus far of the puzzle is that God desires for us to create an online community of hikikomori and to use games, blogs, and various forms of media to connect with these people. Our goal is to cultivate a community, lead by the Holy Spirit, who will love others in the community supernaturally as Christ loves us. We will be meeting their relational needs, but also meeting their emotional needs by connecting them with anonymous, professional counseling. We believe God desires to transform these people and set them free from their self-confinement then go on to reach their friends and family for the Gospel."

I felt like God might be calling me to start an online discipleship group at our church, but I wasn't exactly sure where I would start or who I could invite to come. I thought that perhaps I had misheard from God, but Amanda urged me to continue waiting. I’m very glad I did. I connected with a very interesting man by the name of Matt Souza. Him and his wife run an online gaming church whose mission is to reach gamers throughout the world. The group is known as GodSquad gaming. I met with Pastor Souzy, as he is fondly known in his church, and we discussed vision. \"How exactly are you going to reach these shut-ins in Japan,\" Souza asked me, to which I replied honestly, \"I don’t know exactly. I was hoping your church could help with that!\" I was certainly stumped in that moment, but I knew that I had stumbled across something good. Here was someone who was not only doing what I believed God was calling me to do right here in this moment, but someone who clearly has a lot of these details worked out and can help further us in our future vision in Japan. We plan on meeting Pastor Souzy and his wife in person in February. After that, we’re going to start serving alongside his staff to learn exactly what makes this ministry so successful. Praise God!"
